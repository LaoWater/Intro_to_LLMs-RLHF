# üìò Introduction to Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
Welcome! This repository is a step-by-step guide through my Learning Blueprint of RLHF concepts, emphasizing simplicity and clarity over production-level complexity.  
The goal is to build understanding gradually, starting from a basic algorithm and advancing towards creating and training a Reinforcement Learning model with human feedback.

## üîç Introduction  

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a method where models are trained not just by algorithms but with human feedback, refining them iteratively for improved and more aligned responses. This project breaks down RLHF concepts into digestible steps, enabling a hands-on learning experience for students and enthusiasts alike.

### Why this approach?

Real-World Anchored: Moves from basic models to sophisticated feedback-driven learning, simulating practical model alignment techniques.
Immersive: Emphasizes intuitive learning and incremental complexity for gradual understanding.
Student-Focused: Designed for learners in the field of Machine Learning, particularly those curious about RLHF and LLM fine-tuning at the beginning of their journey.


## üìù Phase Summaries  

## Phase 1: Foundational Concepts in Grid Search  
In this phase, we start at the ground level with a simple grid-based algorithm, where the model explores possible solutions with constraints. Here, the goal is to help the model randomly seek solutions, enabling it to understand basic movement within a structured environment.  

Version 1: Initial Random Search Algorithm  

Version 2: Enhanced Cost Function, Human Feedback Integration  


## Phase 2: Hugging Face Model Benchmarking and Evaluation  
Building upon foundational knowledge, we dive into pre-trained models from Hugging Face.  
By benchmarking models of varying dimensions, we explore fundamental parameters and libraries available in Hugging Face, like AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, GPTNeoForCausalLM, and GPT2Tokenizer.  

Key Libraries: Hugging Face Transformers, Pytorch  
Benchmark Dimensions: Model size, evaluation criteria, and alignment with project goals.  


## Phase 3: Training with Custom Dataset and Evaluation  
In Phase 3, we step into model fine-tuning.  
Using a pre-processed and tokenized dataset, we train an LLM, exploring and optimizing training parameters like epochs, learning rate, and loss metrics.  
Dataset Type: PromptGenerated  
Model Training: GPT-2 fine-tuning with log tracking and visualizations.  



## Phase 4: Exploring Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback  
The culmination of our learning journey, Phase 4, involves RLHF.  
Here, we utilize human feedback to refine the model's responses based on four evaluation dimensions: coherence, creativity, relevance, and fluency.  
We rate responses on a 1-5 scale, quantifying the feedback for training enhancement.  

RLHF Libraries: Transformers, Pytorch  
Evaluation Dimensions: Average ratings calculated for coherence, creativity, relevance, and fluency.
